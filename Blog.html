        <p>With the average number of jobs a person works in a lifetime projected to grow over the next fifty years, lifelong learning has never been more important. Online courses and degree programs make it easier for us to learn the skills we need to land those jobs over the course of our lifetime while we work and care for our families.But with the powerful explosion of online course offerings over the last ten years, there has come the great responsibility of choosing an online education that hiring committees will trust. That’s where we come in.</p><br>
        <p>Since 2013, we’ve been ranking free online courses, paid online courses, and online degree programs according to the metrics that matter most to adult learners who work: Flexibility, Affordability and Academic Quality.During that same time frame, we’ve also been studying, publishing, and closely following the most recent developments in the online education industry. So we know about where the industry has been and where it’s going.</p>
